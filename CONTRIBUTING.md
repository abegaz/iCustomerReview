### Code Commits

Push code changes to a `working` or `test` branch if pushing from an IDE. Avoid pushing to `master`. Please do **not** push to `master` if the code contains errors. I recommend the naming convention `<feature>-working` so we can work with multiple features at once and then use **rebase** when merging branches back in.

### Assignment Commits

Documentation for assignments should go in `/Project Documents/` and can be committed straight to `master`.
