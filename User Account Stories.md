1. As a customer I want to be able to leave a review for this product so that I may tell other potential customers that this product is bad/good.
2. As a customer I want to be able to rate this product on a scale so that I may show my satisfaction with it. 
# Robert’s UAS:
1.	As an avid online shopper I want to isolate valid reviews to have peace of mind that the product I want to buy is properly reviewed.
2.	As someone who doesn't read many reviews, I want to be able to see a star rating adjusted to fit valid reviews so that I can easily determine the quality of a product.
# Benmo’s UAS:
1.	As a well known reviewer I would like this platform to have a system or symbol for certified reviews for others to see. So that people will know who is serious about the reviews and who is trolling.
2.	As a product user I would like to have a link to better rated products of the same type if the product I view has had bad reviews. I think this will bring a bigger scope of products to the user.
