1.	As an online shopper I want to isolate valid reviews to have peace of mind that the product I want to buy is properly reviewed.
2.	As an online shopper, I want to be able to see a star rating adjusted to fit valid reviews so that I can easily determine the quality of a product.
# Benmo’s UAS:
1.	As a reviewer I want this platform to have a system or symbol for certified reviews for others to see. So that people will know who is serious about the reviews and who is trolling.
