### Code Commits

We should push code changes to a  `working` or `test` branch before we push anything to `master`. We should only push to `master` after the branch is sufficiently tested and unlikely to contain severe errors.

### Assignment Commits

Documentation for assignments should go in `/Project Documents/` and can be committed straight to `master` as necessary.
